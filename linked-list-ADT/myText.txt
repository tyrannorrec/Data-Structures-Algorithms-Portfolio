This is an example of a text file.  I am creating fake text to test
the ability of my program to read in a text file into a string buffer.  
I then intend to use sscanf to read individual variable contents 
into their own receptacle variables.  Placeholders are variables that
hold content in the middle of a process.
This is the end of my text file.  I am continuing on in my pursuit to
create artificial text.
